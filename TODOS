Cyclical healing:
	=> A symlink may depend on a directory, but the directory may not exist yet (and directory runs
			after symlink).  This could be fixed by changing the priorities, but this could introduce a
			situation where a directory depends on a symlink.  Instead, all Managers must ONLY heal their
			type (ie, symlinks can't do mkdir_p), but there should be some method to go back and heal
			things that failed.
			
			After healing, put all failtures in a failture bucket for that Manager instance, after healing
			process, start healing again using just the newest failures, if the number of failures change, 
			continue to loop the healing process until either 0 errors or the error count doesn't change.
