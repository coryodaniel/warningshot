==== WarningShot's Dependencies...
  Ive cheap-o implemented some dependencies just so WarningShot wouldn't have to install a bunch of gems.
  If you feel the need to buff them up (things like FileSystemResource, Growl) feel free.  If you think
  we should include the full gem, lets talk.

#
# @param *list [~to_s]
#   A list of things
#
# @return [Array(String)]
#   The list in an array, how useful.
