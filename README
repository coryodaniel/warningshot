WarningShot Dependency Resolution Framework

==== How it works
  * WarningShot - Factory class that creates and runs DependencyResolver
  * DependencyResolver - Locates Resolver classes, creates a dependency tree, and matches resolvers to resolution branches
  * Resolver - Class that can be included to create plugins.  Composed of tests and resolutions that can determine if a dependency was met, and if not, how to fix it
