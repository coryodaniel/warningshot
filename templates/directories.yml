# The PermissionResolver piggybacks on the FileResolver, SymlinkResolver and DirectoryResolver.
#  Each of the config files associated with those resolvers can include the following
#  options in their hash to be parsed by the permission resolver.  So you will not generally have a 'permission.yml' file.
#  Instead these options should be specified on a file in files.yml directories.yml or symlinks.yml

# Each environt takes an array hashes
# @param target [String] REQUIRED
#     the path to check permissions
#
# @param mode [String] OPTIONAL;
#     MOde of file 0777, 0755, etc
#
# @param user [String|Integer] OPTIONAL;
#     User that should own resource (name or ID)
#
# @param group [STring|Integer] OPTIONAL;
#     Group that should own resource (name or ID)
#
# @param recursive [String|nil] OPTIONAL; Default nil
#     What methods should be recursvie: 'chmod','chown','both'
#
# You can additionally set permissions like:
# - { target: "/tmp/cool_directory", mode: "777", user: "www-data", group: "www-data", recursive: "both"}
