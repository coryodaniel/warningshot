# You can add your own environments below.  Requirements listed in
# the 'global' environment are always checked

# Each environt takes an array of strings or hashes(src,local,md5)
# src is where it can be found
# local is where it should be
# md5 is the md5 the 'local' copy should hash to, this is optional and used by IntegrityResolver
